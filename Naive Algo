1) Start in the leftmost column
2) If all tetriminos are placed
    return true
3) Try all columns in the current row.  Do following for every tried column.
    a) If the tetrimino can be placed safely in this column then mark this [row, 
        column] as part of the solution and recursively check if placing  
        tetrimino here leads to a solution.
    b) If placing tetrimino in [row, column] leads to a solution then return 
        true.
    c) If placing tetrimino doesn't lead to a solution then umark this [row, 
        column] 
4) If all columns have been tried and nothing worked, move to the next row.
5) Try all rows in the current column.  Do following for every tried row.
    a) If the tetrimino can be placed safely in this row then mark this [row, 
        column] as part of the solution and recursively check if placing  
        tetrimino here leads to a solution.
    b) If placing tetrimino in [row, column] leads to a solution then return 
        true.
    c) If placing tetrimino doesn't lead to a solution then umark this [row, 
        column] (Backtrack) and go to step (a) to try other rows.
6) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger 
    backtracking.


//Functions:

1. Solver function 
2. Placed Safely function 
	- 




//Thoughts:
1. Once a piece has been placed, the remaining pieces coordinates need to increment. 
	- increment will first happen on the pieces column coordinate by { ...... }
